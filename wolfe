Questions on Cary Wolfe, "Human, All Too Human"

1. Why is defining animal studies "like herding cats," according to Wolfe? What are some of the challenges of articulating the field's history and its development that he surveys early in the essay? What does he believe is special about the present moment (the essay was published in 2009) in the development of "animal studies" as a field?

2. Wolfe observes the tendency to read the emergence of animal studies as a logical consequence of the long march of "cultural studies" work towards ever-greater diversity and inclusivity, from women's studies and Black studies in the 1970s to gay and lesbian studies in the 1980s to queer studies in the 1990s to disability studies in the 2000s What, in his view is the problem with embedding animal studies in this sequence or genealogy? What is different about animal studies that makes it a problematic candidate for greater "inclusivity" of subjects who have been "silenced" or "excluded" from full representation in society?

3. Why is Jacques Derrida's essay on animality, according to Wolfe, "arguably the single most important event in the brief history of animal studies"? What does Derrida do there to shift the way we might think about the relationship between human animals and other animals? Note: we're gonna read this essay soon!

4. At the end of the essay, Wolfe raises questions about the "humanism" that drives so much of the work in (logically enough) the "humanities." What are some of the problems that arise from this "humanism" when it attaches to the study of animals and to human-animal interactions?
