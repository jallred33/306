1. Butler starts the essay with ruminations on “trouble.”  What does she observe about the social-political function of “trouble”?  What does she find troubling about the way gender and “trouble” are linked?
2. What is Butler’s response to the rather commonsensical idea that bodies and minds are two different things, and that one can reasonably think of bodies as things that are “inscribed” with meaning through social channels?
3. Most of the time, we think of our bodies as clearly bounded things, with a skin that separates ourselves from the outside world.  A bit more abstractly, we think of ourselves as selves, unique persons with an invisible inner core that structures our uniqueness.  What does Butler bring to bear on both of these assumptions we commonly make?
4. What is “abjection”?  How does the process of abjection contribute to the development and maintenance of a self?  To the development and maintenance of a society?
5. What can one learn about gender from going to a drag show?  Why is drag such an important practice for Butler?  What are the two incompatible statements that every drag queen implicitly makes about him/herself by means of the drag performance?
6. What is Butler’s response to the feminist belief that drag shows are sexist?
