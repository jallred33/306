## Course Sites/Open Syllabi:
- [MITs Open Course on Theory,](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/literature/21l-451-introduction-to-literary-theory-fall-2014/) taught by Shankar Ramen
- [Plymouth St U (NH) open textbook](https://opentheoryhandbook.pressbooks.com/): co-authored by instructor Abby Goode and students (!), fascinating example of what Ranciere calls the “ignorant schoolmaster” model of pedagogy. It’s basically headnotes without texts: would be a worthy challenge to “fork” this and make it a more serviceable textbook, using a combination of public-domain texts and in-copyright texts accessible via our library proxy.

## Document repositories/anthologies:
- [Foucault.info](https://foucault.info/) : great-looking open collection of essays and book chapters that includes many of MFs warhorses in English and a few in French.
- [Marxists Internet Archive](https://www.marxists.org/): damn near everything Marx wrote, including texts by a wide range of Marx-related thinkers from Adorno to Zola.
- Ryan/Rivkin:
    - [ebook version of classic anthology](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/huntercollege-ebooks/detail.action?pq-origsite=primo&docID=7103984) that competes with the ubiquious, expensive Norton. One crucial limitation is that only three users can use it at a time *per* the license. So better for “extra” readings for students doing deeper dives, perhaps?
    - [Practical Introduction to Theory](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/huntercollege-ebooks/detail.action?pq-origsite=primo&docID=7104395): spinoff of the above, with summary chapters of “schools” followed by readings of primary texts informed by various approaches.

## Encyclopedic resources:
- [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html): thorough open-yet-peer-reviewed encyclopedic resource. Very useful for a deeper dive than, say, the Norton headnotes afford.
- [JHUs Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism:](https://litguide.press.jhu.edu/)  extremely useful resource, with articles on major names, schools, and concepts.
- K[eywords for Gender and Sexuality Studies](https://cuny-hc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9994482117706133&context=L&vid=01CUNY_HC:CUNY_HC&lang=en&search_scope=IZ_CI_AW&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine): available via Hunter Library proxy, useful set of Raymond Williams-style keywords in the field. The Library has Keywords to Latino/a Studies and Environmental Studies [in the same series](https://cuny-hc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?query=title,exact,Keywords%20Ser.%20,AND&search_scope=IZ_CI_AW&vid=01CUNY_HC:CUNY_HC&mode=advanced&offset=0).

## Podcasts:
- The Dig Podcast: Jacobin’s offshoot podcast that features academics and activists talking about a wide range of topics touching on Marxism and labor history.
    - [Michael Denning’s two-parter on Gramsci’s legacy](https://thedigradio.com/podcast/gramsci-hegemony-w-michael-denning/) is superb (if long) and gives a wonderful overview that helps to contextualize the tiny snippet on “the intellectuals” that the Norton gives
- [Philosophy of Psychoanalysis](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1005889) Nina McIlwain's charming podcast lectures giving broad overview of themes in psychoanalytic thought.
- [Lectures on Lacan](https://lecturesonlacan.substack.com/) Samuel McCormick's close readings, with a reading group of practicioners, of key Lacan texts.

## Miscellaneous:
- [David Harvey’s video lectures](http://davidharvey.org/reading-capital/) on Marx’s Capital: amazing repository of hundreds of hours of Harvey’s lectures, chapter by chapter, derived from his decades-long participation in *Capital* reading groups. And as of May 2023, he has lectures on [*Grundrisse*](http://davidharvey.org/2022/12/register-for-reading-marxs-grundrisse-with-david-harvey/) (he said breathlessly)!

- This [Purdue site on psychoanalysis](https://cla.purdue.edu/academic/english/theory/psychoanalysis/) is old and “ugly cute” but has some very useful material
- The [Theory and Philosophy](https://theoretician.podbean.com/) site seems useful. Have only scratched the surface, but there seem to be podcasts and video lectures that are competent, clear, and helpful to students on an extensive range of theoretical pieces.
