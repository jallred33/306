## From ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL MANUSCRIPTS (651-4):

1. How does economic life look from the perspective of the worker?  From that of the owner?  How does Marx use this question of perspective to reframe the question of the economic, political, and cultural values created by liberal-capitalist society?
2. What are some of the ironies Marx observes in the economic status quo of his era (the 1840s, at the time of this writing)?
3. What does Marx mean by “alienation”?  How do workers become “alienated” and what are they alienated from?

## From THE GERMAN IDEOLOGY (655-6):
1. What does Marx mean by “ideology”?  How is ideology like a “camera obscura”?
2. What are the implications of this understanding of “ideology” for us critics of culture?  Once we’ve understood what ideology is and how it works, what is our job in society?

## From CAPITAL: (776-83 only!)
1. Marx tells us that the commodity, which looks so simple, is “in reality, a very queer thing.”  Why is this?  How does a commodity look different, depending on whether we view it as a) something to use, b) something to make, or c) something to buy/sell?
2. What is the “fetishism of commodities”?  Why does Marx use the metaphor of the fetish (i.e., an object invested with mystical powers in a religious rite)?  What is the rhetorical force of this metaphor?
3. What is the “secret” (or, to use another of Marx’s metaphors, the “hieroglyph”) bound up in the commodity form (778)?
4. What do Robinson Crusoe, the feudal peasantry, and the life of a commune tell us about the commodity and market-based forms of production and exchange?  What do these examples allow Marx to prove (782-3)?
5. What would commodities say, if they could speak (783)?  How does Marx decode this “speech”?
