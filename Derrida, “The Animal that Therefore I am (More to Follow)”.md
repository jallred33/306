## prefatory note:

This is a fantastic piece to close out our semster in many ways: it takes a capacious view of Western thought, from Plato and Homer and Genesis to a “greatest hits” of texts we’ve read together, including Nietzsche and de Saussure on language, Lacan’s “mirror stage,” Althusser’s dialectic of recognition and subject formation, Spivak’s speculations on how “silenced” subjects might be allowed to “speak,” Spillers’s and Fanon’s explorations of how discourses of race render people of color as “beasts” of a sort, and of course Haraway’s and Wolfe’s writing about the animal.

It’s also, as you may be noting, a very difficult piece. I urge you to spend some time with Monsieur Derrida, one of the richest and most varied critical minds of the twentieth century, but I also eat this essay like a messy sandwich (preferably vegetarian), letting some bits drop back onto the plate, pigging out, perhaps, without worrying about getting all of it (whatever that would mean).

To change the metaphor, what I find fascinating about this piece is the way Derrida works like a virtuoso improviser in jazz, “blowing the changes,” passing back over the same idea multiple times, circling back on himself, inserting little jokes and quotations, such that no one reader will “get” them all but all readers will “get” some.

A final note: those who still need “lifelines” should pay special attention to the questions. They’re tough, and I don’t expect you to have easy answers. But I will arrange class Thursday and Monday, such that all who need to check this box can do so. The best strategy is to focus on two or three questions and jot down some ideas, so you’re ready when called on! We’ll discuss the first 1/2 on Thursday, so do your best to read at least through p. 394 by then. Questions 1-5 below are fair game for Thursday, and the rest we will tackle on Monday.

1. What do you make of the strange title of this essay, “The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)”?  Take a look at the translator’s note on 369 for some initial guidance on Derrida’s wordplay, and trace (to use one of JDs favorite metaphors) the use of the idea of “following” in the essay. One clue to get you going: “follow” has a certain ambiguity in French as in English: one can “follow” in the sense of “coming after,” in the way “one thing follows another” in time; one can also “follow” in a more active sense, pursuing someone or something (as prey, as a love interest, as a leader, etc.) with an aim to “catching” him/her/it/them. You might also look at 379-80 for help here.
2. On 372, Derrida describes a hilarious, cringy moment, in which his cat observes him in the nude. Far from playing this moment for laughs, however, Derrida uses this moment to leverage fundamental questions: “who I am,” “who I am (following),” what kind of “recognition” might occur in both directions between a man and a cat (or, to follow JDs skeptical approach, “what calls *itself* man and what *he* calls the animal”)? How would you represent visually (say, in a similar sketch to my drawing of the baby before the mirror in Lacan’s essay) the dynamics that pertain between Derrida and the cat? How does Derrida develop the themes of “nudity” and “shame” through this moment?
3. What does Derrida observe about the different ways philosophers and creative writers think about animality? (see p. 377 ff.) Note that a bit later, Derrida supplements this contrast with “two types of discourse” about animals (382). What are these two ways of looking at animality, “the animal,” animals, an animal?
4. On 383-7, at the tail end (sorry) of his discussion of the “poetic” way of understanding animals, Derrida gives a *very* subtle reading of Genesis 2, in which God commands/allows Adam to name the animals. How does Derrida read this seemingly simple story? What are some of the ambiguities he finds between competing accounts, and how do those ambiguities reflect on his broader argument?
5. What is the “historical turning point” that Derrida locates around 1800? What are its hallmarks in philosophy and “on the ground” in the socio-economic facts of modern life? Pay special attention to the discussion of Bentham on 396 and change that Bentham’s question about animal “suffering” introduces into philosophy.
6. What in the world does Derrida mean by the “limitrophy” that is the subject of his second hypothesis on p. 397? What does this word mean, or what are some of its meanings? If the mainstream of Western thinking posits a “unilinear and indivisible line” separating humans from (other) animals, what does Derrida propose by way of contrast on pp. 397-400? What is “asinine” about the binary dividing humans from animals, and what is Derrida’s response to this “asininanity”?
7. What are some answers Derrida gives to the question, “The animal that I am (following), does it speak?” What does this question mean in the first place, and what are some approaches to this question in Derrida’s essay?
8. On 403 and following, Derrida provides, not an “autobiography” but a “zootobiography,” a chronology of the many references in his own substantial body of work to animals. Beyond the little joke of the “A to Z” implicit in the made-up word “zootobiography,” what are some of the implications of the relationship Derrida’s thinking has had with animals throughout his career? Note: [Derrida died two years after the publication of this piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/14/opinion/what-derrida-really-meant.html), so there’s something very moving about this self-reflexive act, pulling together his life’s work as, among many other things, a meditation on the “human” via animals and animality.
9. Towards the end of the essay, Derrida starts to use the invented term *animot* to refer to the object of his study. What does this term mean (see footnote 27!)? Why do you think he refers to animals this way at the end, rather than the prior terms “animals,” “the Animal,” “what man *calls* ‘animal,’” etc.? How does the “mot” in “animot” push us to reconsider the use of *language* as a useful dividing line between humans and (other) animals?
10. Derrida’s essay ends with another long riff on ancient texts—the Greek myth of the Chimera and the story of Cain and Abel that is common to the “Abrahamic” religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam). How do these myths relate to the theme of the “animot,” and what do they add to the end of Derrida’s essay?
