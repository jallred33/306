Achille Mbembe, "Necropolitics" (2003)

1. Mbembe starts by disagreeing with a common-sense understanding of sovereignty. To oversimplify a bit, he points out that the mainstream definition of sovereignty (say, the body of US citizens and its representative goverment), rests on a) a body of rational, equal subjects and b) a set of norms governing how laws, elections, etc. must function in order to be legitimate. What is Mbembe’s counter-model? How does he ground the idea of “sovereignty”?

2. How does Mbembe’s “necropolitics” relate to Foucault’s “biopolitics”? Is this a simple opposition between mode of politics organized around “life” and “death,” or is there something more complicated going on?

3. Mbembe relies heavily on the category of space: necropolitics names practices that unfold in spaces that are outside of or somehow apart from the ordinary spaces of the state, such as plantations, concentration camps, occupied territories and colonies. What does Mbembe find in these spaces that confounds more mainstream ways of thinking about politics and pushes us to consider this new category of “necropolitics”?

4. We think of death and life as opposites, states that exclude one another. How does Mbembe question this way of thinking? In what ways does necropolitics being living and dying into close proximity or indistinctness?

5. Mbembe ends the essay with a long meditation on the figure of the “suicide bomber” seeking “martyrdom.” What implications does this practice have for necropolitics? How does the suicide bomber enact the inner logic of the broader form of necropolitics, according to Mbembe?
