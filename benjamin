1. What is "aura" in Benjamin's sense? What factors produce it? What social and cultural factors create it? Why is "aura" less prevalent in modernity, roughly since the mid-19th century?
2. What is the social function of "aura" and how does the function of art change when the aura is stripped away by "mechanical reproducibility" in art objects?
3. How does the value of the art object change when it's made a) more portable and therefore available for "exhibition" and b) reproducible and thus available for wide dissemination?
4. What's the difference between a stage play and a movie for a) the actors and b) the audiences?
5. How does cinema, the paradigmatically "mechanically reproduced" artform, change perception? What can we see/understand/know through the cinema that we can't through prior artforms?
6. Explain Benjamin's analogy, MAGICIAN: PAINTER :: SURGEON: CINEMATOGRAPHER.
7. What are the implications of Benjamin's argument that "distraction" is the dominant state in which "mechanically reproduced" art is consumed?
8. How does Benjamin link fascism and socialism at the end of the essay? What are the two pathways he sees that open up before art in the age of its mechanical reproducibility?
