# Final Project

There are three options for the final project. The first is a bit more "prefab" and synthetic of the material we read together. The second and third are more self-directed, but in different ways. My hope is that you choose a path that plays to your strengths as a reader and writer and allows you to explore more about what theorists/theories/schools of thought most deeply inform your understanding of texts and the world they reference.

## option one: synthetic grab-bag

Students who choose this option will choose **three** from the following list of questions and develop responses to each in brief essays of 800-1000 words, similar to our blog posts but more carefully considered, cited, and written. Successful responses will provide close readings of texts we read and use parenthetical citation. I won't require a Works Cited, since I assume you'll be citing the same texts in the same editions that we read together in class. Responses should be well-organzied, with clear introductions and good transitions.

1. How has this course changed the way you read and write?  What critic/s or school/s do you find particularly compelling?  What makes that critic/school more compelling that competing models/theories/approaches?  Knowing what you now know about theory, what questions can you ask of texts that you hadn’t previously asked?
2. Take a look at this image, created by the artist Luis Kamnitzer. What does this object tell us about subjectivity?  What happens to us when we encounter it?  That is, how might it transform us to realize that our selves are bound to mirrors/sentences/writing?  Don’t try to engage them all, but you might think about Nietzsche, Saussure, Johnson, Althusser, Lacan, or Spivak, among others.
