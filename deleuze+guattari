## Deleuze and Guattari, from *A Thousand Plateaus* (Norton 1454-62)

1. The first sentence is memorable—“The two of us wrote ANTI-OEDIPUS together.  Since each of us is several, there was already quite a crowd” (1601).  What’s the joke?  What does this opening tell us about the “voice” of this essay?  What clues does it give us regarding how we should read it?
2. The authors’ series of metaphors of the body (and the book) as an “a body without organs,” an “assemblage,” a “desiring machine,” etc.  are quite various and confusing.  What do you think they’re getting at?  What are they arguing *against* here and what do they advocate instead?
3. Explain the differences between the three types of books the authors describe—the “root-book,” the “fascicular root,” and the “rhizome” (1603-5).  What is distinctive about the “rhizome” as a structure?  Why do the authors uphold this as a model for a new and better way of writing/thinking/acting?
4. What do the authors say about the process of writing their book and their organizational schema?  Why write this way?  Why not write a “normal” book in a “normal” manner (1606)?
5. What is the difference between “nomadology” and “history”?
