## **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of the semester, students will gain:

- broad knowledge of major concepts, thinkers, and arguments in literary and cultural theory from the mid-19th century to the present
- facility in spontaneously speaking and writing about theory via class discussion and informal writing
- close reading/analytic skills in careful engagement with demanding philosophical prose.

## **Course Description:**
This class will survey a wide range of texts that engage crucial topics for students of literature and culture: for example, the formation and definition of the "literary"; the way sign systems work to make and unmake meaning; the political effects of literary texts; the psychological dimensions of reading and writing; and the relationships between literature, performance, and identity.   

Students will leave the class with an array of interpretive and analytic tools that will enrich their reading and especially writing in subsequent courses both within the English department and throughout the humanities. Authors include a theoretical Who’s Who from Althusser to Zizek. Side effects may include: vertigo, sublimity, a persistent feeling of being watched, Oedipal stirrings, and queer sensations.  Requirements: thorough reading, enthusiastic participation and attendance, several short response papers, midterm, and a final.




## **Grading:** 

This course experiments with a "contract grading" model. In brief, students will sign contracts for A/B/C grades and complete a quantity of work that corresponds to that grade. A detailed rationale and list of requirements is [here](https://engl306spr25.commons.gc.cuny.edu/grade-contract/). You'll choose the grade you're contracting for and submit a contract by **Wednesday, February 4th**.


## Technology:

We will use Brightspace this term for the basics of tracking the reading schedule, communicating with each other, and receiving feedback from the instructor. We will rely more heavily on the time-tested technologies of paper, print, pencils, and/or pens, so bring those to class every day.

## Writing and Research Help

In addition to course assignments and instruction, the [Reading/Writing Center](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/rwc) can help you to improve your literacy skills and develop your writing style.

For research help, Hunter College Libraries provide online databases and other remote resources. Hunter librarians can help you leverage these resources for your projects. Here are some ways:

- [Five ways to contact the library](https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/ask-a-librarian)
- Contact English subject librarian [Jennifer Newman](mailto: jn1314@hunter.cuny.edu). 
- Instructions to access the Hunter Library from off-campus are here: [https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/remote-access](https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/remote-access).

## Attendance/Participation:

Faculty are required to certify student attendance. You are urged to keep abreast of any attendance requirements that may be set by Hunter, government agencies or others with regards to qualification for financial aid, fulltime status, etc.

See the contract document for detailed expectations regarding participation. I do expect regular, vigorous participation in our discussions and other activities. Having said, that, I recognize that there may be factors beyond your control that inhibit the quality and quantity of your participation (e.g., childcare issues, sickness, etc.). Please reach out if you have issues and plan ahead when possible. Remember that to be excused, medical documentation must indicate that you were incapable of working on the assignment while confined.
