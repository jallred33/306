1.	Why does OEDIPUS REX move audiences so deeply?  Why can’t other, more modern playwrights create this effect by writing new plots within the same pattern of the “tragedy of destiny”?
2.	What is the difference between OEDIUPS REX and HAMLET?  How does Freud explain this difference?  
3.	What is the “new task” that Freud lays out for himself in the interpretation of dreams?  How does it differ from former approaches?
4.	How does Freud describe the “language” of latent content, that is, of the unconscious?  How does one go about “translating” it?
5.	Given the “condensation” of the latent content of dreams, how does one unpack them?  How does one know, in other words, when one is finished “translating” a dream?
6.	What is “displacement”?  What causes it?  Why, in other words, do dreams appear to us in “code,” as it were; why can’t they just come out and say it!?
7.	We know that dreams use images (Freud argues we should read them like “rebuses”); so how do these image-driven entities represent logical connections?  What, in other words, is the “grammar” of dreams, and how does learning it help us to interpret them?
