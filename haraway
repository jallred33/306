1. What are some of the ideas or philosophical positions she wants to argue against at the very top? 
2. The third paragraph has, if you’ll pardon the expression, a really big “but”: how does Haraway crack the essay open (sorry) here and take things in a new directions? Whom does she cite and how does she try to awaken us to the magnitude of thinking we need in order to comprehend our present and future?
3. Midway through the essay, Haraway insists that the existing names are inadequate for our moment, and that we need “a big new name, actually more than one name” for it. What are the implications of these different names? What do you make of Haraway’s hesitancy to settle on just one of them? What in the world does she mean by the ungainly term "Chthulucene"?
4. What is the “slogan” Haraway provides for her new “Chthulucene” periodization? What’s the difference between making “kin” and making “babies”: initially, they seem the same, right? Why is “making kin” so crucial to Haraway’s thought?
5. How does this piece end? What are the implications of projecting a future utopia in which the human population has shrunk by 75% or more? How does this vision conflict with widely held ideas about what the future holds?
