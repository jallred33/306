This site was created by [Professor Jeff Allred](http://cuny.is/jallred) and shared by members of two courses at Hunter College: COMPL 301 and ENGL 306.  Course members will post reflections on a wide range of classic texts in literary and cultural theory.  The header image comes from a work, ["Survival Series" (1991)](https://risdmuseum.org/art-design/collection/survival-series-200770) by the conceptual artist Jenny Holzer.  For me, the image confronts us in a condensed way with some of the fundamental issues of language, subjectivity, and power that we reckon with in the course.
