1. What is the relationship between linguistics and "semiology" (or "semiotics")? Why does Saussure think that language is an especially interesting object to study rather than, say, the symbolic systems that govern cinema or fashion or pantomime or ballet?
2. What's the problem with thinking of language as a process of giving names to things. In other words, why is the diagrams on p. 827 an improvement on the diagram on p. 826?
3. What does Saussure mean when he says that the two "primordial" characteristics" of a given sign within a system are its arbitrariness and its "linear nature"? This covers a lot of ground: he introduces these concepts on pp. 828 and clarifies them throughout the essay!
4. Explain Saussure's analogy of the signifier/signified as two sides of the same sheet of paper (830).
5. What does Saussure say about the relationship between thought and language (830-1)?
6. How is language like money (832)? What aspects of linguistic function does this analogy help us to recognize?
7. What does Saussure mean by saying, "in language there are only differences" (836)?
8. Define "syntagmatic" and "associative" relations, according to Saussure. The analogy of the Greek column is helpful here (837-40)!
