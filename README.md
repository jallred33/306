materials for Spring term of 2022 at Hunter College, ENGL 306, sections 4 and 6
## Course Description:
This class will survey a wide range of texts that engage crucial topics for students of literature and culture: for example, the formation and definition of the "literary"; the way sign systems work to make and unmake meaning; the political effects of literary texts; the psychological dimensions of reading and writing; and the relationships between literature, performance, and identity.   

Students will leave the class with an array of interpretive and analytic tools that will enrich their reading and especially writing in subsequent courses both within the English department and throughout the humanities. Authors include a theoretical Whoâ€™s Who from Althusser to Zizek. Side effects may include: vertigo, sublimity, a persistent feeling of being watched, Oedipal stirrings, and queer sensations.  Requirements: thorough reading, enthusiastic participation and attendance, several short response papers, midterm, and a final. This is a synchronous course that will include Zoom meetings and occasional asynchronous elements, like video lectures and informal writing.
