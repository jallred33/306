1. How does the essay start?  How does the shock of the racial slur link up with Fanon’s subsequent claim to being “an object in the midst of other objects”?  How do the quotations of unnamed speakers work throughout the essay to drive home Fanon’s argument?
1. What does Fanon mean when he says, on p. 3, that he existed “not as a third person” (that is, a he/she/it) but as a “triple person”?
1. What is the difference, for Fanon, between being Jewish and being black in a racist society?  What’s the difference, in other words, between being “overdetermined from within” and “from without”?
1. What is Fanon’s problem with white liberals who accept blacks and other minorities as part of a universal “humanity”?
1. On p. 9, Fanon says that he began to “secrete” a racial identity in response to the “anklyosis [stiffness, inflexibility] of the white man.”  What is the nature of this “blackness,” and how does Fanon describe or exemplify it?  How is it linked to whiteness?
1. On p. 12, Fanon observes that, one’s he’s constructed/inhabited “blackness,” the white man “went through my pockets.”  What does he mean by this?  If blackness is what whites despise, why do they wish to rob it?
1. What is Fanon’s argument with Jean-Paul Sartre near the end of the essay?  What does Sartre miss with his narrative of the emergence of “negritude” as a phase in a larger Marxist narrative of class-consciousness?
1. What are some of the psychological possibilities or positions Fanon considers at the end?  What are the implications of being a “toy,” an “explosion,” a stunted limb, etc.?
