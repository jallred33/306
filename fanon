## Fanon, "The Fact of Blackness" from *Black Skin, White Masks* + selection from *The Wretched of the Earth*

### "The Fact of Blackness"
1. How does the essay start? Where does the (Black) subject find themselves? Who else is present, and how does Fanon represent their interaction?
1. What are some strategies that strategies this embattled subject attempts to shore up a stable, free identity? What are some of the problems that arise after Fanon “puts the white man in his place” on 1355?
1. At the end of the essay, Fanon recedes, giving center stage to a wide range of writers from the African diaspora. Whom does he quote, and what’s the effect of this mosaic on the argument?
1. Why does FF emphasize “damage” or psychological/bodily wounds in this section?
1. How does the essay end?  Is there a happy ending?  Who gets the checkmate?


### from *The Wretched of the Earth*:

1. What happens to indigenous cultures under colonialism, according to Fanon?
2. How do indigenous elites and indigenous masses react differently to the cultural violence of colonial occupation and governance?
3. Who is the “native intellectual” Fanon mentions on 1363? What is their social role?
4. How do the changed circumstances “on the ground” during anticolonial resistance change culture? What new forms and styles tend to emerge, according to Fanon, and why?
5. What does Fanon have to say to those who believe “nationalism” is backwards and regressive? He’s talking back to, on the one hand, the “patriotic” spirit that celebrates one’s national traditions, and, on the other, the “cosmopolitan” spirit that celebrates the “citizen of the world” who is open to all cultures and believes in “open borders,” so to speak.
Fanon asks, rhetorically, what relationship pertains between the “struggle” (political or military) and “culture.” What are some of his answers?
