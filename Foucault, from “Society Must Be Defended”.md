## Questions:
1. Foucault starts the essay with a long riff on classic political theory around “sovereignty.” Sovereignty, as an idea, grows out of “social contract” theory and explains how a ruling power (a king, an emperor, an elected government) justifies and exercises that power over its subjects. Foucault points out something startling here: that sovereignty is grounded in the “right of life and death.” What does he mean by this? Which of these rights or powers is more important in his view?
2. How is the “old” model of sovereignty complemented by a “new” model, starting in nineteenth century? What is the significance of this new model?
3. The central distinction that drives this essay is that between “disciplinary” power and “biopolitics.” This gets very complicated, but what are some of the contrasts between these two faces of power? What is the central *object* of each? What are some of the *techniques* that each requires? What’s an example of “disciplinary” power at work, and what’s an example of “biopolitics”? Feel free to use Foucault’s examples or, even better, invent your own.
4. Foucault analyzes changes in the way death is viewed, beginning in the late eighteenth century (1445). How does death change, from the rather abstract point of view of “biopolitics”? If the old way of reckoning with death stemmed, as he argues, from the notion that, in dying, we are moving from subjection to one sovereign (the King, say) to another (God), what replaces this ideology, and what does that change tell us about the nature of biopolitics?
5. After dwelling at length on all the contrasts between disciplinary and biopolitical power, Foucault ends the essay by bringing them together and thinking about how they work in tandem. Sexuality (the subject of a massively influential three-volume work by Foucault) looms large here: how does the field of sexuality combine both kinds of power?
