1. What is “slow violence”? How does the anecdote about Lawrence Summers’s memo help us to understand it? What are some of the tensions between the ideas of slowness and violence? Why is slow violence hard for us to see, grasp, and respond to?
2. What does Nixon mean by the “environmentalism of the poor”? Given that the environment, by definition, affects us all, how does environmentalism manifest differently from the perspectives of relative wealth and relative poverty? From the developed North and the underdeveloped Global South?
3. How does the distinctive temporality we live in in the 21st century play into the problem of slow violence? How does Nixon relate the macro scale of the Anthropocene to the micro scale of neurological and psychological changes in our own moment? Not to pile on, but Tik Tok, I’m looking at you!
4. Why is slow violence so hard to see? Are there other ways of grasping it and combating it that move beyond metaphors of vision? How does this question about seeing relate to Nixon’s closing issue of “who counts as a witness”?
