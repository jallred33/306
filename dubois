1. Beneath the various well-intentioned questions Du Bois reports being asked by white people, he hears a second, unvoiced question: *How does it feel to be a problem*? What's strange about this question? How does this question, with all its variants, "interpellate" Du Bois in a certain way, as Althusser would put it some 70 years later?
2. What is the "veil" Du Bois speaks of? How is the "veil" a fitting metaphor for the inner and outer effects of racism in the US in the early 20thC?
3. What is "double consciousness"? How does the subject of this mode of consciousness see the world differently from the (presumed white) bearers of "single" or "unified" consciousness?
