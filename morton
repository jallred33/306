1. What is “the ecological thought”? How does Morton’s construct move against the grain of what we tend to think of as “ecological” or “environmental” research or activism? What is the relationship of imaginative and literary forms, like poems and essays, to this mode of “thought”? How does this mode of thinking relate to traditional ideas of “nature”? Why is it *the* ecological thought”?
2. What are some of Morton’s issues with ideas of “nature”? Why has “nature” lost its usefulness for us, so much so that Morton advocates an “ecology without nature”? Who gets dissed in this section (2623-6) and why? When Morton gets around to giving a more positive definition of “what we call ‘nature’” on 2626, what does he come up with?
3. What kinds of things does “the ecological thought” think? Morton explores the idea of praxis, taken from Aristotle, to point to mixtures of “thinking” with “doing.” What are some examples of this kind of “praxis” that he lays out? How might this more supple form of thought help us avoid “traps” that keep us from protecting ourselves and our world? See especially 2627-9.
4. What is the role of literature, of creative writing, of the humanities in what is often viewed as a very scientific “ecological” discourse? How does Morton defend the value of what we sometimes think of as frivolous and “merely aesthetic” objects and practices, compared to the practicality, clarity, and rigor of science?
