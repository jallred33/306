1. What does Bennett do with the pile of things she finds over a storm drain on 2437? How does this assemblage speak to the theme of “thing power” she develops in the prior section? What are some of the challenges to our usual ways of looking and thinking that arise in coming to terms with these “vital things”?
2. Bennett relates the role played by the wooden spool named (!) Odradek in one of Kafka’s stories on 2439-. How does she describe Odradek’s “identity,” if you will? Who, or what, is Odradek, and how does the difficulty of the pronouns in this sentence resonate with with the “ontologically multiple” status of Odradek in JBs analysis (see 2440 for quote)?
3. Once we humans are not *the* subject, *the* apex creature, *the* Center of Everything, what are we, in JBs argument? How does she revise ideas of where the “human” fits into a “flat ontology”? See 2443 especially.
4. What are the *ethics* of a “vital materialist” outlook? How do we treat ourselves, and other things (including other humans), differently in light of Bennett's ways of thinking?
