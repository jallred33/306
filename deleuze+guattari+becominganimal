1. How do D+G read the "fine unpopular film" *Willard*? What is so meaningful about this seemingly silly film for the authors? Note all the vocabulary that spills out of the text at this point, terms that are surely unfamiliar to those who aren't already steeped in D+G's distinctive lexicon: *molar/molecular*, *assemblage*, *deterritorialization* and *reterritorialization*, etc. The quick sketch of *A Thousand Plateaus* that I posted helps a bit, but I recognize that it's ... a lot.
2. From 234-237 or so, D+G riff on the difference between the way "series" and "structure" understand animals, and the relations between humans and other animals. This is really tough sledding, but what is the difference between these two systems of thought? The "series" is the simpler to understand and the older mode in intellectual history; we might grasp it through [this kind of visualization](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/scythgdfqo9weu0uddjs9/evolution.jpg?rlkey=rq3nbqj8g43kekq9oqdeavx2x&dl=0). The structure is tougher: D+G associate it with the "structuralist anthropology" of Claude Levi-Strauss. What seems to be the principle between this "structural" organization?
3. Things start getting even stranger after 237, as D+G introduce a third mode of organization, the main topic of this section, "becoming-animal." What is this mode of "becoming," and how does it offer a different way of organizing life and experiences than the "serial" or "structural" modes above? What is this "becoming" and (to focus on the clearer side of some murky writing) what is this "becoming" *not*? If you get totally lost but know something about plants and gardening, the "rhizome" vs. "tree" contrast on 239 may help. Rhizomes are plants that reproduce by growing in all directions at once, like many grasses and weeds, as opposed to the "arborial" model of many trees, which often depends on sexual reproduction via pollen and results in forms organized around central trunks (obviously).
4. Why is it a mistake, for D+G, to think in terms of *an* animal? What changes when the "unit," so to speak, by which we evaluate animals is the "multiplicity" or "pack" or "school"?
5. What are the "three kinds of animals" D+G sketch out on 240-1? Can you think of examples of each? Note: as the authors say, this might be better understood as *three ways of looking at animals*.
6. What is the difference between "epidemic" and "filiation" as a way of thinking about how creatures multiply or proliferate? Note: "filiation" (>Latin, "filius" or "filia," "son" or "daughter") is a fancy anthropological terms for genealogical relationships conceived "linearly" from parents to children. How do *vampires* get mixed up in all this?
7. On 247, the authors discuss "the politics of becoming-animal." How does this proximity to a mode of animal life associated with "becoming" rather than "being," with change rather than identity, translate into a politics? You might look at some of the (lightly sketched) examples on 247, in the final paragraph, for help, and the limits or sources of resistance to this politics on 248.
