(on "The Eiffel Tower")
1. What *signifieds* attach to the *signifier* of the Tower? (see p. 4)
2. Among all the implications of the Tower, Barthes gives two special emphasis: the Tower as spectacle, as a thing to be looked at, and the Tower as a tool of sorts for looking.  Why is this pair so significant?  What are some of the tensions or problems associated with this pair?
3. What does RB mean that the tower “does structuralism” on p. 9?

(on "The Reality Effect")
1. What is the problem Barthes identifies in certain objects and events that make up the "setting" of realist fiction? How does he interpret the role played by the "barometer" on top of Mademoiselle Aubain's piano in Flaubert's story? By the portrait made of Charlotte Corday in Michelet's story? What's so strange and problematic about these moments in these stories, for Barthes?
2. What are some of Barthes's answers to the question, "What is ... the significance of [the] insignificance" of the kind of chance objects and incidents that interest him? See p. 1273.
3. How does Barthes link realist fiction to the emergence of modern ways of writing history as "objective" in the 19th century? See p. 1275.
4. What is the "referential illusion" that Barthes references on p. 1276? How does this analysis provide a fuller answer to #1 above? What are some of the implications for how we think about how fictional texts point to real things in the world they reference?

Note: no questions on "The World of Wrestling," but note the way Barthes's "mythology" draws from de Saussure's "semiotic" approach. What are the central oppositions? How does a given gesture or element in the "sign system" of wrestling get what Saussure calls its "signification" by virture of its difference from neighboring or contrasting elements?
